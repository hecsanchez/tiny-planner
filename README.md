# Surely Meal Planner

## Instructions

Build a React app (using Typescript) using this template project that accomplishes the following:

1. Let's you search for `Recipe`s by [diet](#diets), certain [health](#health) restrictions, [meal type](#meal_type), [dish type](#dish_type), [cuisine type](#cuisine_type), and any arbitrary `query` text that appears in the `Recipe` (i.e. `query=chicken`) using the [Edamam Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) with the key that was provided to you.
1. Let's you select `Recipe`s returned and add it to your next 7 day `Meal Plan`.
1. Let's you view a final summary of your `Meal Plan` for the week, showing what to eat each meal of each day of the week, and provides you with the recipes, their instructions, details, etc. grouped by meal type (i.e. `Breakfast`, `Lunch`, `Dinner`, `Snack`).

While we'll be judging this on functionality above all else, feel free to showcase your skills and diligence -- from documentation, testing, design, architecture, and more.

### CSS

Note that the current site uses [skeleton.css](http://getskeleton.com). Feel free to replace this if you like with anything you're more comfortable with.

## APIs
Use the api key and app id that sent to you to populate recipes. If for whatever reason this isn't working, you'll have to sign up for the Edamam API and use your own app id and key.

Note that the test keys given to you are limited and do not allow you to filter across dish and cuisine type. Feel free to handle those items as you like (either show errors from the API properly, ignore those filters, etc).


### Example `curl`

This example curl will use the API to search for alcohol free recipes between 591-722 calories, limiting to three results, which contain the word "chicken" in them.

~~~shell
curl "https://api.edamam.com/search?q=chicken&app_id=${YOUR_APP_ID}&app_key=${YOUR_APP_KEY}&from=0&to=3&calories=591-722&health=alcohol-free"

## Domain Model

Feel free to use this domain model as a starting point for the application.
